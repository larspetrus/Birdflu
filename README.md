#####An exhaustive Rubik's Cube Last Layer position and algorithm database

Birdflu is a specialized tool for serious Rubik's Cube people, but is also useful for any cuber wanting to find 
solutions to a last layer position. It's live at <http://birdflu.lar5.com>

The foundation is a database of all 43 million 17 moves 
or less last layer algs, generated once and for all by Tom Rokicki. 

On top of that is a UI that let you search and filter among all the 3916 last layer positions in different ways, 
and immediately see what algs solve them.

Two advanced features are available when logged in using a WCA account:

1. Mark algs as favorites with stars, and publish alg sets.

2. Pick a set of short "base" algs, and Birdflu will also show all combinations of them as solutions. This 
_could_ be the way of last layer the speedcubing of the future.
